| [MultiUV Test](.%2F2.0%2FMultiUVTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FMultiUVTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model has two uv texture coordinates. |
| [Normal-Tangent Mirror Test](.%2F2.0%2FNormalTangentMirrorTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FNormalTangentMirrorTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This model compares normal maps of various orientations to actual geometry, to test if the model's supplied tangent vectors are being imported and used correctly.  Note that this model (`NormalTangentMirrorTest`) supplies tangent vectors, and specifically tests a rendering engine's ability to use the supplied vectors as opposed to generating them automatically.  To test automatic generation of tangent vectors, see [`NormalTangentTest`](../NormalTangentTest/README.md). |
| [Normal-Tangent Test](.%2F2.0%2FNormalTangentTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FNormalTangentTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This model compares normal maps of various orientations to actual geometry, to test if tangent vectors are being calculated and handled correctly.  Note that this model (`NormalTangentTest`) does not supply tangent vectors, and specifically tests a rendering engine's ability to generate the tangent vectors at runtime.  To test supplied tangent vectors, see [`NormalTangentMirrorTest`](../NormalTangentMirrorTest/README.md). |
| [Orientation Test](.%2F2.0%2FOrientationTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FOrientationTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This model tests the orientation supplied by nodes in the hierarchy.  The red, green, and blue arrows test X, Y, and Z rotations respectively expressed as quaternions in the nodes.

| [SheenChair](.%2F2.0%2FSheenChair%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FSheenChair%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model is a wood-framed chair with a fabric seat, tufted with fabric buttons and metal hardware. It uses three extensions: `KHR_materials_sheen` for velvet fabrics, `KHR_texture_transform` to tile the textures for fabric and  wood, and `KHR_materials_variants` to create two versions of the chair: "Mango Velvet", and "Peacock Velvet".  |
| [Sheen Cloth](.%2F2.0%2FSheenCloth%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FSheenCloth%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | ... no description ... |

| [SpecGlossVsMetalRough](.%2F2.0%2FSpecGlossVsMetalRough%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FSpecGlossVsMetalRough%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This is a modification of the WaterBottle sample model, to compare the metal/rough PBR workflow side-by-side with the spec/gloss PBR workflow. |
| [Specular Test](.%2F2.0%2FSpecularTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FSpecularTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model tests the [`KHR_materials_specular`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_specular) extension, which replaces the older `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness` extension.  The latter was a separate PBR workflow, an alternate to the core glTF metallic/roughness workflow.  This newer `KHR_materials_specular` extension enables control over dielectric specular values from within the metal/rough workflow.  The two extensions are mutually exclusive per material. |
| [Sponza](.%2F2.0%2FSponza%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FSponza%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | ... no description ... |
| [StainedGlassLamp](.%2F2.0%2FStainedGlassLamp%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FStainedGlassLamp%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model represents a real product, a Tiffany-style stained glass table lamp sold on [the Wayfair website](https://www.wayfair.com/).  |

| [Texture Coordinate Test](.%2F2.0%2FTextureCoordinateTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FTextureCoordinateTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This model demonstrates the orientation of texture coordinates.  The materials and accessors have all been named according to function.  In particular, the accessor named `TopLeft_TEXCOORD_0` shows that the upper-left portion of the texture image is represented by texture coordinates ranging from roughly `0.0` to roughly `0.4`. |
| [Texture Encoding Test](.%2F2.0%2FTextureEncodingTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FTextureEncodingTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This asset tests that textures are sampled with correct transfer functions: base color and emissive must be decoded from sRGB while metallic-roughness values must be passed as-is. |
| [Texture Linear Interpolation Test](.%2F2.0%2FTextureLinearInterpolationTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FTextureLinearInterpolationTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This asset tests that linear texture interpolation is performed on linear values, i.e. after sRGB decoding. The test passes when two spheres are rendered with nearly the same color. |
| [Texture Settings Test](.%2F2.0%2FTextureSettingsTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FTextureSettingsTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This model tests the `doubleSided` flag for materials, and tests `REPEAT`, `CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, and `MIRRORED_REPEAT` modes for texture samplers.  When an engine loads this glTF file correctly, all of the boxes in the "Test" column should look very similar to the corresponding box in the "Sample pass" column.  In other words, they should all be green checkmarks, except the two "clamp" tests, which should be solid green boxes. |
| [Texture Transform Multi Test](.%2F2.0%2FTextureTransformMultiTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FTextureTransformMultiTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model tests if KHR_texture_transform is supported across a variety of different texture inputs, and whether `TEXCOORD_1` works and is also transformed. |
| [Texture Transform Test](.%2F2.0%2FTextureTransformTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FTextureTransformTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model demonstrates the usage of the KHR_texture_transform extension. There are six quads in this model using two main textures. |
| [Toy Car](.%2F2.0%2FToyCar%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FToyCar%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model demonstrates the usage of [KHR_materials_sheen](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_sheen/README.md), [KHR_materials_transmission](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_transmission/README.md) and [KHR_materials_clearcoat](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_clearcoat/README.md). |
| [Transmission Roughness Test](.%2F2.0%2FTransmissionRoughnessTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FTransmissionRoughnessTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model tests the interaction between IOR (Index of Refraction) and the perceived roughness of transmission. |
| [Transmission Test](.%2F2.0%2FTransmissionTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FTransmissionTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.jpg) | This model demonstrates the usage of the `KHR_materials_transmission`. The grid of spheres demonstrate different combinations of uniform transmission and textured transmission and how they should render in conjunction with opacity (`baseColor.a`) and surface roughness/metalicity. |

| [Unicode❤♻Test](.%2F2.0%2FUnicode%E2%9D%A4%E2%99%BBTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FUnicode%E2%9D%A4%E2%99%BBTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | Sample glTF model where everything contains Unicode characters: |
| [Unlit Test](.%2F2.0%2FUnlitTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FUnlitTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This model tests the [`KHR_materials_unlit`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_unlit) extension.  There are two objects, one orange-ish (`#FF7F00` in sRGB space) and one blue-ish (`#007FFF` in sRGB space).  The visible surface of these two objects should appear as a uniform color, so much so that the 3D effect is intentionally lost. |
| [Virtual City](.%2F2.0%2FVC%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FVC%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.gif) | ... no description ... |
| [Vertex Color Test](.%2F2.0%2FVertexColorTest%2FREADME.md) | ![](.%2F2.0%2FVertexColorTest%2Fscreenshot%2Fscreenshot.png) | This model tests the attribute semantic `COLOR_0`, as defined in the glTF [Metallic Roughness Material](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#metallic-roughness-material), to check if it has been multipled by `baseColor`.  For engines that read the vertex colors and apply them, you should see two rows of checkmarks, as shown in the screenshot.  The top row is the "Test" row, which has been multipled by red, green, and blue vertex colors to reveal checkmarks in the corresponding color channels.  The bottom row is a "sample pass" row, where checkmarks of each color are multiplied by white and should appear the same as the screenshot regardless of the rendering engine's ability to process vertex colors. |
