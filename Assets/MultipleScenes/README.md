# MultipleScenes

A simple glTF asset with two scenes. Each scene consists of one node with
one mesh. For the first scene, the mesh is a triangle. For the second 
scene, the mesh is a square. The default scene is set to `1` by the `scene` 
property, so viewers should initially show the scene containing the square.
