# glTF V2.0 Sample Models

[![glTF Validation](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/workflows/glTF%20Validation/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/actions)

## Preface
This version of the User Interface was released in March 2023. See [Obsolete Interface]() for links to the previous version.

## Introduction

This Repository is a curated collection of glTF models that illustrate one or more features or capabilities of glTF. 

## Lists

All models are tagged to allow easier access. These lists simplify your access and review of the models. All lists include the model name, screen shot, link to display the model in Sample Viewer, a short description, and the license/credits for the model. The following lists are available

* [Showcase](./Models-showcase.md) for models that are showcased in Khronos publicity. These are usually complex models with high visual quality.
* [Complete](./Models.md) for a complete list of all models.
* [Testing](./Models-testing.md) for models intended to be used for testing of viewers, converts, and other software systems.
* [Core Only](./Models-core.md) for models that only use glTF Core V2.0 features and capabilities (no extensions).
* [Video Tutorials](./Models-video.md) for models used in any glTF Tutorial video.
* [Written Tutorials](./Models-written.md) for models used in a written glTF Tutorial.
* [Issues](./Models-issues.md) for models with one or more issues that need to be resolved.

A summary of the model license is shown in each display, but see the `README.md` in each model's directory for detailed license information.


## Model Contents

Sample glTF 2.0 models are provided in one or more of the following forms of glTF:

* glTF (`.gltf`) with separate resources: `.bin` (geometry, animation, skins) and `.jpg` or `.png` image files.  The supporting files are easily examined when separated like this, but must be kept together with the parent glTF file for the model to work.
* glTF (`.gltf`) with embedded resources (as Data URIs).  This form tends to be larger than the others, but Data URIs do have their uses.
* Binary glTF (`.glb`) using the [binary container format](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md#glb-file-format-specification).  These are easily shared due to the bundling of all the textures and mesh data into a single file.


## Contributing Models

Sample models help the glTF ecosystem, if you are able to contribute a model, see the [contributing section](./SubmittingModels.md).

## Model Publishing Services with glTF Download Capability

* [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/features/gltf) offers auto-conversion of all of its downloadable models, including PBR models, to glTF format.
* [Poimandres Market](https://market.pmnd.rs/) offers 3D assets for download in glTF format.
* [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/) offers CC0 (public domain equivalent) HDRIs, PBR textures, and glTF models.

## Other glTF Models

For addition glTF models, see:

* [Khronos glTF Asset Generator](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Asset-Generator) offers an extensive suite of test models to exercise each part of the glTF specification.
* Cesium's [demo models](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/tree/master/Apps/SampleData/models) and [unit test models](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/tree/master/Specs/Data/Models).
* Flightradar24's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kalmykov/fr24-3d-models) of aircrafts.
* [Kenney â€¢ Assets](https://kenney.nl/assets?q=3d) hundreds of themed low-poly assets (nature, space, castle, furniture, etc.) provided by Kenney under CC0 licenses, including [30+ pirate themed models](https://kenney.nl/assets/pirate-kit).
* [Smithsonian open access 3D models](https://3d.si.edu/cc0?edan_q=*:*&edan_fq[]=online_media_type:%223D+Images%22)

## Obsolete Interface

To make this repository cleaner, the previous _glTF-Sample-Models_ repository was archived to _fill-in_. All V1.0 models were removed from this repository. All non-model folder READMEs were also removed, but the functionality was preserved. Main branch URLs to all glTF V2.0 models did not change. READMEs were provided to assist in navigation to any directories that were removed or substantially changed.
