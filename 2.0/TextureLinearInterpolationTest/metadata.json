        "* The second sphere samples its color as an interpolated value from a `2x1` texture. When interpolation happens after sRGB decoding, the final emissive value should also be about `0.5` green. An example of incorrect interpolation is shown below.",

Such engines will \"fail\" this test, which is designed specifically to highlight a difference that is generally quite subtle. Modern APIs like WebGL 2.0 and WebGPU provide effective ways to avoid this issue._"
