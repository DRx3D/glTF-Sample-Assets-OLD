        "This model contains a simple mesh with two primitives:  A larger red primitive displays a grid covering 3 of the 4 quadrants of the model's area, followed by a smaller green primitive covering the last quadrant.",
        "Each primitive has a morph target that creates an elevated area within these quadrants.  The model's only mesh contains a `weights: [0.5]` instruction that should cause these morph targets to be applied at half strength, raising the center of the model as shown in the screenshot above."
