        "This model demonstrates animated rigging with three different animation cycles: Survey, Walk, and Run.  These animations all drive the same joints, so for this model, only one animation should be active at any given time.  glTF [specifies](https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF\/tree\/master\/specification\/2.0#animations) that the client implementation may choose when to play any of the available animations."
