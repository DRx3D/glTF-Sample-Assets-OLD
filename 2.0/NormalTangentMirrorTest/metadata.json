        "This model compares normal maps of various orientations to actual geometry, to test if the model's supplied tangent vectors are being imported and used correctly.  Note that this model (`NormalTangentMirrorTest`) supplies tangent vectors, and specifically tests a rendering engine's ability to use the supplied vectors as opposed to generating them automatically.  To test automatic generation of tangent vectors, see [`NormalTangentTest`](..\/NormalTangentTest\/README.md).",
        "This test is best performed with an environment map that contains a clear horizon line, so it is easy to spot if the reflection of the horizon is level.  The screenshot above shows a successful render of this model from the front.  All of the test blocks show similar reflections."
