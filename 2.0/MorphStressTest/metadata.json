        "This model has a base mesh, plus eight morph targets.  The base and each of the morph targets has",
        "both a POSITION and a NORMAL accessor, resulting in no less than 18 vertex attributes being requested",
        "by a typical implementation.  This number can be too high for many realtime graphics systems, and",
        "the client runtime may take steps to limit the overall number of morph targets and\/or limit the",
        "number of active morph targets.",
        "As such, this model is not expected to render correctly everywhere.  Instead, it pushes the limits",
        "to see how many morph targets can move at once before problems become apparent."
