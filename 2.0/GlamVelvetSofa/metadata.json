        "This model represents a real product, a velvet sofa bed being sold [on the Wayfair website](https:\/\/www.wayfair.com\/furniture\/pdp\/mercer41-frankie-velvet-86-recessed-arm-sofa-bed-mcrf6337.html). ",
        "The model is made of three parts, each with their own materials. Two 1024x1024 PNG textures are used for the whole model, an ambient occlusion map and a normal bump map. All UVs are arranged between 0 and 1, and `KHR_texture_transform` is used to repeat the normal map for the fabric. The model uses 4319 triangles and 3204 vertices.",
        "The model uses several extensions: ",
        "* [KHR_lights_punctual](https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF\/tree\/master\/extensions\/2.0\/Khronos\/KHR_lights_punctual) to provide a key light for better velvet illumination. Sheen seems to respond better to punctual lights than with image-based lighting alone.",
        "* [KHR_materials_sheen](https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF\/blob\/master\/extensions\/2.0\/Khronos\/KHR_materials_sheen) for velvet sheen.",
        "* [KHR_materials_specular](https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF\/pull\/1719) to colorize facing-angle reflections, which occurs with some fabrics (satins, silks, velvets, etc.).",
        "* [KHR_materials_variants](https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF\/blob\/master\/extensions\/2.0\/Khronos\/KHR_materials_variants\/README.md) to represent the five fabric color options on this product.",
        "* [KHR_texture_transform](https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF\/blob\/master\/extensions\/2.0\/Khronos\/KHR_texture_transform\/README.md) to scale the normal bump texture separately from the ambient occlusion texture."
