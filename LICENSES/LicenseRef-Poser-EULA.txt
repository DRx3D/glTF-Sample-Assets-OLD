DEFINITIONS 


* “Content” means animations, characters, clothing, faces, 
hair, geometries, images, materials, meshes, morphs, 
motion files, props, PoserPython scripts, textures, bump

with the intent of being used within the Program and/or 
third party applications. 


“Documentation” means any written material in any 
form for installation and use of the Program provided by 
authorized agents or representatives of the Company. 


“Legitimate Uses” means (a) creating morph targets based 
on the Restricted Content, provided that any distribution 

of the morph targets will not include the original mesh 
connectivity information (for example, distribution in 

the form of data utilized with morph moving utilities or 

in a .CR2 file that references the original geometry, but 

no inclusion of the complete mesh); (b) creating texture 
templates derived from the Restricted Content to create 
new maps for either Restricted Content or Other Content; 
(c) creating tutorials, books, or other educational materials 
using images of the Program interface or Content for sale, 
distribution, public display, or public performance, provided 
such materials are intended to educate users as to use of the 
Program; (d) creating original Content for sale, distribution, 
public display, or public performance; (e) creating materials 
(e.g., shader trees) for use with either Restricted Content 

or Other Content; (f) creating characters or props based on 
Restricted Content in Proprietary File Formats, where the 
original (or modified) geometry, texture, or other Restricted 
Content files are not distributed with such characters or 
props; or (g) creating PoserPython scripts. 


“Other Content” means Content that is not Restricted 
Content or Unrestricted Content. Other Content may be 
subject to license terms imposed by the Other Content’s

following extensions: CM2, CR2, FC2, HD2, HR2, LT2, 
MC6, MTS, PP2, PZ2, PZ3. 


“Restricted Content” means all Content included with 

or part of the Program that is not Unrestricted Content, 
including without limitation mesh objects (geometry) 

in any format, files in Proprietary File Formats, images, 
materials, texture, transparency maps, Documentation, and 
Company’s proprietary data. 


“Unrestricted Content” means Content included with 

or part of the Program that is specifically identified in the
