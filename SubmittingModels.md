# Submitting New Models

[![glTF Validation](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/workflows/glTF%20Validation/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/actions)

We appreciate sample model contributions; they help ensure a consistent glTF ecosystem.

To contribute a model, open a pull request with:
* A new subdirectory containing
   * The model in as many glTF variations as reasonable (using the same directory structure as the others ([example](2.0/Box))). Tools for converting to glTF are [here](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF#converters).
   * A screenshot of the model, stored in a subdirectory called `/screenshot`
   * A metadata JSON file containing various information about the model. The file must be in the new subdirectory with the name metadata.json. It will be automatically upgrade if need be. See **Example Metadata File** (below) for details
   * A optional README.md with information about the model. As shown in [this example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/master/2.0/Box/README.md). The metadata determines if this file is automatically generated. It is best if you create one with more information than can be auto-generated. When provided this file should at least include the following elements:
      * The name or title of the model
      * An embedding of the screenshot
      * Information about the license under which the model is published. It is best to format it according to the auto-format rules (see below). Khronos recommends use of a permissive license like [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or even [Creative Commons 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication ](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), to allow people to share and adapt the models for their own use.    
* The model will be listed in all displays based on the tags in the metadata.

If you have any questions, submit an [issue](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/issues).

## Example Metadata File

The metadata file is always called metadata.json and is located in the model root directory (not the root directory of the repo). It specifies the necessary metadata of the model including its name, ownership, artist, license, and tags. The current version of the JSON structure is below. If you are unsure of the details, set the version number to less than the current and the system will automatically upgrade the file.

~~~
{
    "version" : 2,
    "legal" : [
        {
            "artist" : "",
            "owner" : "",
            "year" : "",
            "license" : "",
            "what" : ""
        }
      ],
    "tags" : [],
    "screenshot" : "screenshot/screenshot.jpg",
    "name" : "",
    "path" : "",
    "summary" : "",
    "createReadme" : false
}
~~~

The _legal_ structure contains information about each owner of the model. It comprises of the following elements:

* _what_: What was done to get the model to this stage. Standard terminology includes _Everything_ or _Creation_ for the initial work; _Mesh_ for the geometry; _Texture_ for all materrials; _Animation_ for movement; and _Conversion_ for converting to glTF.
* _artist_: The name of the artist(s) who performed the _what_.
* _owner_: The owner of the model for this operation. This is may be the _artist_ or the organization responsible for the _artist_. If the work is in the Public Domain, then the _owner_ may be **Public**.
* _year_: The year the work was performed.
* _license_: The licensed assigned by the owner. Standard license shorthand should be used. The known shorthand is

  * CCO
  * PD
  * CC-BY / CC-BY International 4.0
  * CC-BY-ND
  * CC-BY-NC
  * CC-BY-NC-ND
  * _others?_


# License & Credit Format

The system can automatically generate a license and credit block in the format below. If you manually generate a README file, then please try to follow this format as much as possible. This item is repeated as many times as necessary. Put the oldest item first.

~~~
Â© <year>, <owner>. <license name> (with optional link to legal text)
 - <artist> for <what>
